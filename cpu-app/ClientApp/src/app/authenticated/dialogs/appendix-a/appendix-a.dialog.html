    <span>APPENDIX A - Social Service Group Liability</span>
</div>
<div mat-dialog-content>
    <p>All programs are encouraged to secure liability insurance for their volunteers and are advised to seek legal advice regarding risks and liabilities associated with implementing and operating a program.</p>
    <p>There are several ways that your organization can obtain liability insurance:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If your program is part of an umbrella organization, your volunteers may be eligible for coverage under its master policy.</li>
        <li>If your volunteers report directly to a municipal employee or a municipal contractor, coverage may be available through the municipality’s insurance.</li>
        <li>If your organization is affiliated with an agency that is under contract to the province, it may already be covered by government’s Social Services Group Liability Program (SSGLP).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It may be in the best interest of programs to seek accident coverage, commonly called AD&D or Accidental Death and Disability, for their volunteers. If this coverage is desired, it is up to the funding recipient to arrange for it through the commercial insurance market.</p>

    <p><b>SOCIAL SERVICES GROUP LIABILITY PROGRAM</b></p>

    <p>The Social Services Group Liability (SSGLP) coverage provides $2,000,000 per occurrence of commercial general liability insurance. The program is similar to a group insurance program in that all members of the group share similar characteristics and can therefore be covered under one policy. The Province provides this coverage to eligible contractors at <b>no cost</b>. If service providers feel this limit is not adequate, they can purchase excess coverage from the commercial insurance market, usually at a reasonable cost.</p>

    <p>Community Accountability Programs have been offered coverage through SSGLP to help volunteer-based programs get started. SSGLP is not designed to replace commercial insurance nor to cover interests that should be insured elsewhere, and some programs may have ‘outgrown’ their eligibility for this coverage.</p>

    <p><b>Ineligible service providers:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Service provider carries their own commercial general liability insurance.</li>
        <li>Service provider is on the list of SSGLP Excluded Entities as updated by RMB from time to time.</li>
        <li>Registered professionals (e.g., a nurse, a clinical counsellor, a social worker, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Ineligible contracts/services:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Services outside the scope of Province Authority’s service plan, mandate letter, or enabling legislation. </li>
        <li>Professional services.</li>
        <li>Contracts that are exclusively for professional services (e.g., nursing, clinical counselling, social work, etc.) are entirely ineligible.</li>
        <li>Contracts that include incidental professional services in the context of a larger engagement for non-professional services may be enrolled in SSGLP; however, the professional services are excluded from coverage and no professional liability claims will be covered by SSGLP.</li>
        <li>Services are provided directly to the Province Authority (i.e., first party service contracts).</li>
        <li>Funding-only contracts (i.e., grants: no term, no services provided directly in exchange for funds). </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Social Services Group Liability Program Coverage:</b></p>

    <p>Limit of Coverage: $2,000,000 per occurrence</p>

    <p>Type of Coverage: Third Party Liability Insurance</p>

    <p>Deductible: $1,000 on Third Party Property</p>

    <p>Included in the coverage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bodily Injury Liability </li>
        <li>Property Damage Liability</li>
        <li>Personal and Advertising Liability</li>
        <li>Employees and Volunteers as Additional Insureds when performing the Services</li>
        <li>Subcontractors as Insureds when performing the Services under a written contract</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This coverage only extends to the performance of the Services described in a written agreement between the Province Authority and a service provider where those Services are performed by the service provider and/or by approved subcontractors who have entered into a written agreement to perform the Services. For greater certainty, coverage only pertains to Services described in the main agreement no matter how many times the Services have been transferred to another layer of service providers.</p>

    <p>Not included in the coverage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Damage to building or contents and other property owned, rented, used or occupied by the service provider</li>
        <li>Activities not described in the main agreement with the Province Authority</li>
        <li>The service provider’s business risks (for example, employment practices liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, errors and omissions liability)</li>
        <li>Professional liability</li>
    </ul>


    <p><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
    <p>Limit of Coverage: $2,000,000.00 per occurrence</p>
    <p>Type of Coverage: Third Party Liability Insurance</p>
    <p>Deductible: $250 on Third Party Property</p>
    <p>Insurance Broker: Aon Reed Stenhouse</p>

    <p>It is important to note that SSGLP coverage only extends to those operations related to the delivery of the contracted services on behalf of the Ministry and for which the Ministry has agreed to provide coverage. No coverage is provided for activities outside that relationship. However, if an agreed upon operation is partially funded from an outside source, that operation is fully covered by this policy.</p>

    <p><b>Included in the coverage:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-Owned Automobile</li>
        <li>Cross Liability Clause</li>
        <li>Blanket Contractual</li>
        <li>World Wide Territory Limits</li>
        <li>Medical Malpractice</li>
        <li>Counseling and Consultation Malpractice</li>
        <li>Directors’ and Officers’ Liability</li>
        <li>Products and Completed Operations</li>
        <li>Employees and Volunteers as Additional Insured</li>
        <li>Subcontractors approved by the Province as Additional Insured</li>
        <li>Contingent Employers Liability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The policy does not insure damage to building or contents and other property owned, rented used, or occupied by the contractor.</p>

    <p>Once eligibility for SSGLP is confirmed, the Ministry will enroll the contractor for SSGLP. The insurance brokers, Aon Reed Stenhouse, will e-mail a copy of the policy wording, a certificate of insurance and a brief coverage summary.</p>

    <p>The insurance coverage is effective from the contract term start date until the contract term ends. Further, it should be noted that SSGLP only cover the contractor for the term and the services performed within the scope of the specific contract.</p>
